INTRODUCTION                                                      *introduction*

*push.vim* is a plugin to push text in the current line to a "push stop" in a
line above the current one (called a reference line).
Its purpose is to align text with the text in some line above (or below).

Depending on the actual function a "push stop" may either be the beginning of
a word or the end of a word in a reference line.

To find a "push stop" this plugin looks in the lines above the current one
until it finds a push stop that is further to the right than the cursor (or
the start of the current word, respectively).


==============================================================================
MAPPINGS                                                              *mappings*

All mappings exist for normal mode and insert mode.
They differ slightly in that the normal mode mappings push whole words
around, while the insert mode mappings always push from the current
cursor position, even if the cursor is inside a word (and therefore it splits
the words at the cursor position).

All the mappings have support for |tpope/vim-repeat| and are therefore
repeatable with the dot command.

  <Plug>(PushToNextWord)                                     *push-to-next-word*
  <Plug>(PushToNextWORD)                                     *push-to-next-WORD*

      Push the current word (in normal mode) or the cursor (in insert mode)
      to the next push stop.
      Both mappings differ only in what they consider a 'word'.
      The first mapping considers a word to be a number of keyword-characters
      preceded by at least one non-keyword character.
      The second mapping considers a word to be a number of word-characters
      preceded by at least one whitespace character. Therefore they are in
      line with vims use of "word" and "WORD".
      See ':h word' and ':h WORD'.

      Example:  >

      Nunc         habeo        feugiat               albucius
      Quo     lorem                      pro
      Nibh integre eros debet dicta.
<
      If the cursor is on the word 'integre' at the last line, calling
      <Plug>(PushToNext) in normal mode aligns it with the next word in the
      line above, 'lorem'.  >

      Nunc         habeo        feugiat               albucius
      Quo     lorem                      pro
      Nibh    integre eros debet dicta.
<
      Calling it a second time aligns it with the next word in the line above,
      'pro'. >

      Nunc         habeo        feugiat               albucius
      Quo     lorem                      pro
      Nibh                               integre eros debet dicta.
<
      Calling it a third time will align it with the next word two lines
      above, 'albucius', as the line directly above does not contain any more
      push stops. >

      Nunc         habeo        feugiat               albucius
      Quo     lorem                      pro
      Nibh                                            integre eros debet dicta.

  <Plug>(PushToNextWordBelow)                          *push-to-next-word-below*
  <Plug>(PushToNextWORDBelow)                          *push-to-next-WORD-below*

      Those mappings are the same as <Plug>(PushToNextWord) and
      <Plug>(PushToNextWORD), but push to the push stop in the lines /below/
      the current one instead of the lines above.

  <Plug>(PushFarthest)                                        *push-to-farthest*

      Push the content of the line from the current word (in normal mode)
      or the cursor (in insert mode) to right align with a reference line
      above.

      Example: >

      <Plug>(MyPlugMap)                                       *my-plug-map*
      <Plug>(OtherPlugMap) *other-plug-map*
<
      If the cursor is on the word *other-plug-map* in the second line,
      calling <Plug>(PushFarthest) will push the word to right align with
      the line above. >

      <Plug>(MyPlugMap)                                       *my-plug-map*
      <Plug>(OtherPlugMap)                                 *other-plug-map*
<
  <Plug>(PushCursorBack)                                           *push-cursor*
  <Plug>(PushCursorBACK)
  <Plug>(PushCursorBackBelow)
  <Plug>(PushCursorBACKBelow)
  <Plug>(PushCursorForward)
  <Plug>(PushCursorFORWARD)
  <Plug>(PushCursorForwardBelow)
  <Plug>(PushCursorFORWARDBelow)

      Push the cursor to the corresponding push stop without doing
      modifications to the text in the buffer. The nomenclature is the same as
      for the other mappings described above. The cursor may be pushed forward
      or backward. The uppercase variants jump WORD-wise. If the mapping name
      ends in "Below", the push stop is search in the lines /below/ the
      current one instead of the lines above.

      Even though those mappings are actually motions and do not change
      anything in the buffer, they are repeatable via the dot command by
      integrating with |tpope/vim-repeat|.


Default mappings                                              *default-mappings*

Unless |g:push_no_default_mappings| is set to `v:true` the following
mappings will be applied (for normal mode as well as for insert mode):

  *<Tab>w*    `<Plug>`(PushToNextWord)
  *<Tab>W*    `<Plug>`(PushToNextWORD)
  *<Tab>dw*   `<Plug>`(PushToNextWordBelow)
  *<Tab>dW*   `<Plug>`(PushToNextWORDBelow)
  *<Tab>e*    `<Plug>`(PushFarthest)
  *<Tab>b*    `<Plug>`(PushCursorBack)
  *<Tab>B*    `<Plug>`(PushCursorBACK)
  *<Tab>db*   `<Plug>`(PushCursorBackBelow)
  *<Tab>dB*   `<Plug>`(PushCursorBACKBelow)
  *<Tab>f*    `<Plug>`(PushCursorForward)
  *<Tab>F*    `<Plug>`(PushCursorFORWARD)
  *<Tab>df*   `<Plug>`(PushCursorForwardBelow)
  *<Tab>dF*   `<Plug>`(PushCursorFORWARDBelow)

COMMANDS                                                              *commands*

  :PushHelp                                                          *:PushHelp*

      Open a help window displaying the current key mappings and settings
      of push.vim

      If |skywind3000/vim-quickui| is available the help content will be
      shown in a popup dialog. Otherwise a normal split window will be
      used.
      The split window can be closed with either `q` or `gq`.


==============================================================================
SETTINGS                                                              *settings*

*g:push_no_default_mappings*

    Set to `v:true` to to avoid the |default-mappings|.
